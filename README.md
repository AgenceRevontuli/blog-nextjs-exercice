## What we learn ? 

To help you, you've to use all mathodes : 
getStaticProps()
getStaticPaths()
getServerSideProps() 

Also need to learn how to make a layout component to display the navbar on all page without copy the component on all pages. 

You will learn too how to fetch data from an extern API.

I'm not using Bootstap or Tailwind on this projet. 
I prefer to make my own css with css component logic. 
Maybe is not the right or best way to do, but if you want to improve, i'll be happy to ear about it. 

## Example

And I'll upload an video of my achievement for beginners like me who want to start nextJS.
